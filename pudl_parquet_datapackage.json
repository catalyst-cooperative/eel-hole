Each record describes an individual fuel delivery. There can be multiple deliveries of the same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same plant in a single month, so the table has no natural primary key.\n\n\nUsage Warnings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\n* Date column arbitrarily uses the first of the month.\n\n* Some values have been redacted.\n\n* Time of fuel deliveries is not necessarily connected with time of fuel consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere can be a significant delay between the receipt of fuel and its consumption, so\nusing this table to infer monthly attributes associated with power generation may not be\nentirely accurate. However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. It's\nstill reported to EIA and influences the aggregated (state, region, annual, etc.) fuel\nprices they publish. From 2009-2021 about 1/3 of all prices are redacted. The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.",

This generation only includes generating units that are managed by a BA or whose operations are visible to a BA.\n\nGenerators on the distribution system—both large-scale resources and small-scale distributed resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems—are typically not included.\n\nIn some electricity publications, EIA reports generation from all utility-scale\ngenerating units in the United States. BAs only meter generating units that are from a subset of all utility-scale generating units. As a result, when hourly generation from the EIA-930 is aggregated to monthly or annual levels, the results will be lower than monthly and annual aggregations in other EIA electricity publications.\n\nInterchange is the net metered tie line flow from one BA to another directly\ninterconnected BA. This table includes the net sum of all interchange occurring between a BA and all of its directly interconnected neighboring BAs. For a detailed breakdown of interchange between each pair of adjacent BAs see\ncore_eia930__hourly_interchange.\n\nNegative interchange values indicate net inflows, and positive interchange values indicate net outflows.\n\nDemand is a calculated value representing the amount of electricity load within a BA's electric system. A BA derives its demand value by taking the total metered net electricity generation within its electric system and subtracting the total metered net electricity interchange occurring between the BA and its neighboring BAs.\n\nEach BA produces a day-ahead electricity demand forecast for every hour of the next day. These forecasts help BAs plan for and coordinate the reliable operation of their electric system.",

The primary keys would have been: plant_id_eia, generator_id, subplant_id and emissions_unit_id_epa, but there are some null records in the generator_id column. ~2 percent of all EPA CAMD records are not successfully mapped to EIA generators.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis table is an augmented version of the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd\ncrosswalk table which initially comes from the EPA's Github repo camd-eia-crosswalk:\nhttps://github.com/USEPA/camd-eia-crosswalk.\n\nThis table identifies subplants within plant_ids, which are the smallest coherent units\nfor aggregation. A plant_id refers to a legal entity that often contains multiple distinct\npower plants, even of different technology or fuel types.\n\nEPA CEMS data combines information from several parts of a power plant:\n\n* emissions from smokestacks\n* fuel use from combustors\n* electricity production from generators\n\nBut smokestacks, combustors, and generators can be connected in complex, many-to-many\nrelationships. This complexity makes attribution difficult for, as an example,\nallocating pollution to energy producers. Furthermore, heterogeneity within plant_ids\nmake aggregation to the parent entity difficult or inappropriate.\n\nThis table inherits from the EPA's crosswalk, the IDs from EPA CAMD\ncore_epacems__hourly_emissions table itself, the core_eia860__assn_boiler_generator table and the\ncore_eia860__scd_generators table. While the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd table is the core backbone of the table,\nEPA CAMD IDs ensure there is complete coverage of EPA CAMD reporting units. The EIA 860\ntable addition ensures there is also complete coverage of those units as well.\n\nFor more information about the how this subplant_id is made, see the documentation for\n:func:`pudl.etl.glue_assets.make_subplant_ids` and :func:`pudl.etl.glue_assets.update_subplant_ids`.\n\nBut by analyzing the relationships between combustors and generators,\nas provided in the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd crosswalk, we can identify distinct power plants.\nThese are the smallest coherent units of aggregation.",

Where the post-2020 data (from XBRL) sorts the data\ninto rate schedule types: residential, industrial, commercial,\npublic_lighting, public_authorities, railroads, interdepartmental,\nprovision_for_rate_refund, commercial_and_industrial, total, and billing\nstatus: billed, unbilled, total, the pre-2021 data stuffs all of that\ninformation (if you're lucky) into the rate_schedule_description column.\nThere's no point trying to parse through the pre 2021\nrate_schedule_description column en masse because it's just too messy. The\ncontents of rate_schedule_description often contain numbers and acronyms\nthat have little to no meaning out of context. The table is structured\nsomewhat like the FERC1 small generators table with headings about rate\nstructure type also embedded into the rate_schedule_description column. To\nall who dare, beware.\n\nThis table is a combination of one pre-2021 (DBF) table and nine post-2020\n(XBRL) tables--one for each rate schedule type plus totals--hence increase\nin data clarity post-2020. The rate_schedule_type and billing_status\ncolumns are only relevant for post-2020 data as they can be reliably parsed\nfrom each of the tables and incorporated into columns. The\nrate_schedule_description is supposed to contain sub-rate_schedule_type\nnames for charges (Ex: Residential 1, Residential 2, etc.). However, the\npre-2021 data contains a little bit of everything (or nothing) and the\npost-2020 has some totals or wonky data thrown in. That's to say, even when\nworking with post-2020 data, be wary of aggregating the data. That's what\nthe \"total\" rows are for.\n\nThe values that come from from the totals table are marked with the string\n\"total\" in the rate_schedule_description column. The totals table is a\nproduct of the transition to XBRL, so these distinguishable totals are only\navailable for data post-2020 (otherwise you could try keyword searching for\n\"total\" in rate_schedule_description). The total table contains two types of\ntotals, the utility totals across all rate schedules in a given year\n(marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and rate_schedule_type =\n\"total\") and each of the utility's individual rate schedule totals in a\ngiven year (marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and\nrate_schedule_type = \"residential\" or any other rate schedule type).\n\nThe rate schedule based XBRL tables only report billed values whereas the\ntotal tables report billed, unbilled, and total values. (See the column\ndescription for more info on the difference between billed and unbilled).\nThis is important to consider if you're endeavoring to compare the subtotal\nvalues with the total values. We have not attempted to fix or verify any\nsubtotals or totals that don't add up.\n\nAnother important note is the possibility of unit discrepancies in certain\ncolumns. The revenue_per_kwh column does not specify reporting units, and\ncloser inspection of the data reveals two clear peaks approximate two orders\nof magnitude apart. This indicates that values may be reported in both\ndollars and cents. However, because the price of energy per kwh varies\nso much regionally, we cannot guarantee which is which and have not put\nany cleaning mechanisms in place to account for this.",

This table has filled in source IDs for all records so you can select the full timeseries for a given respondent from any of these three IDs.\n\nAn important caveat to note is that there was some cleaning done to the datetime_utc timestamps. The Form 714 includes sparse documentation for respondents for how to interpret timestamps - the form asks respondents to provide 24 instances of hourly demand for each day. The form is labeled with hour 1-24. There is no indication if hour 1 begins at midnight.\n\nThe XBRL data contained several formats of timestamps. Most records corresponding to hour 1 of the Form have a timestamp with hour 1 as T1. About two thirds of the records in the hour 24 location of the form have a timestamp with an hour reported as T24 while the remaining third report this as T00 of the next day. T24 is not a valid format for the hour of a datetime, so we convert these T24 hours into T00 of the next day. A smaller subset of the respondents reports the 24th hour as the last second of the day - we also convert these records to the T00 of the next day.",

Fuel quantity is reported in standard\nEIA fuel units (tons, barrels, Mcf). Heat content per unit of fuel is also reported,\nmaking this table useful for calculating the thermal efficiency (heat rate) of various\ngeneration units.\n\nThis table provides better coverage of the entire fleet of generators than the\n``core_eia923__monthly_generation_fuel`` table, but the fuel consumption reported here is not directly\nassociated with a generator. This complicates the heat rate calculation, since the\nassociations between individual boilers and generators are incomplete and can be\ncomplex.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for plants and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported.

Each record describes an individual fuel delivery. There can be multiple deliveries of the same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same plant in a single month, so the table has no natural primary key.\n\n\nUsage Warnings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\n* Date column arbitrarily uses the first of the month.\n\n* Some values have been redacted.\n\n* Time of fuel deliveries is not necessarily connected with time of fuel consumption.\n\n* Data has been drawn from several EIA sources which are not always consistent with each other, and PUDL chooses the most consistent or relevant value to facilitate cross-referencing even if that means some values will differ from the raw sources. See `Harvesting <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_dictionaries/usage_warnings.html#harvested>`_ for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere can be a significant delay between the receipt of fuel and its consumption, so\nusing this table to infer monthly attributes associated with power generation may not be\nentirely accurate. However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. It's\nstill reported to EIA and influences the aggregated (state, region, annual, etc.) fuel\nprices they publish. From 2009-2021 about 1/3 of all prices are redacted. The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for plants and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported. If an attribute was reported\ninconsistently across the original EIA tables, then it will show up as a\nnull value.",

However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. It's\nstill reported to EIA and influences the aggregated (state, region, annual, etc.) fuel\nprices they publish. From 2009-2021 about 1/3 of all prices are redacted. The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for plants and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923.

Each record describes an individual fuel delivery. There can be multiple deliveries of the same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same plant in a single month, so the table has no natural primary key.\n\n\nUsage Warnings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\n* Date column arbitrarily uses the first of the month.\n\n* Some values have been redacted.\n\n* Time of fuel deliveries is not necessarily connected with time of fuel consumption.\n\n* Data has been drawn from several EIA sources which are not always consistent with each other, and PUDL chooses the most consistent or relevant value to facilitate cross-referencing even if that means some values will differ from the raw sources. See `Harvesting <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_dictionaries/usage_warnings.html#harvested>`_ for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere can be a significant delay between the receipt of fuel and its consumption, so\nusing this table to infer monthly attributes associated with power generation may not be\nentirely accurate. However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. It's\nstill reported to EIA and influences the aggregated (state, region, annual, etc.) fuel\nprices they publish. From 2009-2021 about 1/3 of all prices are redacted. The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for plants and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported. If an attribute was reported\ninconsistently across the original EIA tables, then it will show up as a\nnull value.",

This\n  table includes only ~40% of the total MMBTUs reported in the\n  :ref:`core_eia923__monthly_generation_fuel` table.\n* The :ref:`core_eia860__scd_generators` table provides an exhaustive list of all\n  generators whose generation is being reported in the\n  :ref:`core_eia923__monthly_generation_fuel` table.\n\n\n\nIn this table, PUDL aggregates the net generation and fuel consumption that has been allocated to the ``generator_id``/``energy_source_code``/``prime_mover_code`` level in the:ref:`out_eia923__yearly_generation_fuel_by_generator_energy_source` to the generator level.This process does not distinguish between primary and secondary energy_sources for generators.

Expect nulls.\n\n* Data has been drawn from several EIA sources which are not always consistent with each other, and PUDL chooses the most consistent or relevant value to facilitate cross-referencing even if that means some values will differ from the raw sources. See `Harvesting <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_dictionaries/usage_warnings.html#harvested>`_ for details.\n\n* Contains information from multiple raw inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis table includes all monthly attributes\nfor all generators reported to EIA-860 and EIA-923.\n\nTo provide a complete picture of generator data, this table compiles data from many\ndifferent EIA tables, including directly reported, imputed and calculated columns.\nWe suggest using this table if you want to explore monthly attributes about generators\nand would rather use a more complete and denormalized table. If you are more interested\nin the originally reported values, we recommend searching for core_eia with the column\nyou are most interested in.\n\nThe calculations of capacity factor, heat rate, fuel cost per MMBTU and fuel cost per MWh\nare based on the allocation of net generation reported on the basis of plant, prime mover\nand energy source to individual generators - which comes from this table:\n:ref:`out_eia923__monthly_generation_fuel_by_generator`.\n\nHeat rates by generator-monthly are estimated by using\nallocated estimates for per-generator net generation and fuel consumption as well as the\n:ref:`core_eia923__monthly_boiler_fuel` table, which reports fuel consumed by boiler.\nHeat rates are necessary to estimate the amount of fuel consumed by a generation unit,\nand thus the fuel cost per MWh generated.\n\nPlant specific fuel prices are taken from the\n:ref:`core_eia923__monthly_fuel_receipts_costs` table, which only has ~70% coverage,\nleading to some generators with heat rate estimates still lacking fuel cost\nestimates.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for generators, plants, and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported. If an attribute was reported\ninconsistently across the original EIA tables, then it will show up as a\nnull value.",

Expect nulls.\n\n* Data has been drawn from several EIA sources which are not always consistent with each other, and PUDL chooses the most consistent or relevant value to facilitate cross-referencing even if that means some values will differ from the raw sources. See `Harvesting <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_dictionaries/usage_warnings.html#harvested>`_ for details.\n\n* Contains information from multiple raw inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis table includes all yearly attributes\nfor all generators reported to EIA-860 and EIA-923.\n\nTo provide a complete picture of generator data, this table compiles data from many\ndifferent EIA tables, including directly reported, imputed and calculated columns.\nWe suggest using this table if you want to explore yearly attributes about generators\nand would rather use a more complete and denormalized table. If you are more interested\nin the originally reported values, we recommend searching for core_eia with the column\nyou are most interested in.\n\nThe calculations of capacity factor, heat rate, fuel cost per MMBTU and fuel cost per MWh\nare based on the allocation of net generation reported on the basis of plant, prime mover\nand energy source to individual generators - which comes from this table:\n:ref:`out_eia923__yearly_generation_fuel_by_generator`.\n\nHeat rates by generator-yearly are estimated by using\nallocated estimates for per-generator net generation and fuel consumption as well as the\n:ref:`core_eia923__monthly_boiler_fuel` table, which reports fuel consumed by boiler.\nHeat rates are necessary to estimate the amount of fuel consumed by a generation unit,\nand thus the fuel cost per MWh generated.\n\nPlant specific fuel prices are taken from the\n:ref:`core_eia923__monthly_fuel_receipts_costs` table, which only has ~70% coverage,\nleading to some generators with heat rate estimates still lacking fuel cost\nestimates.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for generators, plants, and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported. If an attribute was reported\ninconsistently across the original EIA tables, then it will show up as a\nnull value.",

There\nare many attributes of generators (i.e. prime mover, primary fuel source, technology\ntype). We can use these generator attributes to group generator records into larger\naggregate records which we call \"plant parts\". A plant part is a record which\ncorresponds to a particular collection of generators that all share an identical\nattribute and utility owner. E.g. all of the generators with unit_id=2, or all of the\ngenerators with coal as their primary fuel source.\n\nThe EIA data about power plants (from EIA 923 and 860) is reported in tables\nwith records that correspond to mostly generators and plants. Other datasets\n(cough cough FERC1) are less well organized and include plants, generators and\nother plant parts all in the same table without any clear labels. This plant part table\nis an attempt to create records corresponding to many different plant parts in order to\nconnect specific slices of EIA plants to other datasets.\n\nBecause generators are often owned by multiple utilities, another dimension of\nthis plant part table involves generating two records for each owner: one for the\nportion of the plant part they own and one for the plant part as a whole. The\nportion records are labeled in the ``ownership_record_type`` column as ``owned``\nand the total records are labeled as ``total``.\n\nThis table includes A LOT of duplicative information about EIA plants. It is primarily\nmeant for use as an input into the record linkage between FERC1 plants and EIA.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for generators, plants, and utilities.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported.

The modifications were applied to either provide more specificity (i.e. we converted some `total` utility_type's into `electric`) or to condense similar categories for easier analysis (i.e. creating a `hydraulic_production` plant_function by combining `hydraulic_production_conventional` and `hydraulic_production_pumped_storage`).\nSee ``pudl.output.ferc1.Exploder`` for more details.

See `Notable Irregularities <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sources/ferc1.html#notable-irregularities>`_ for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe pre-2021 data in this table (extracted from FoxProDB vs. XBRL) is\nextremely unstructured. Where the post-2020 data (from XBRL) sorts the data\ninto rate schedule types: residential, industrial, commercial,\npublic_lighting, public_authorities, railroads, interdepartmental,\nprovision_for_rate_refund, commercial_and_industrial, total, and billing\nstatus: billed, unbilled, total, the pre-2021 data stuffs all of that\ninformation (if you're lucky) into the rate_schedule_description column.\nThere's no point trying to parse through the pre 2021\nrate_schedule_description column en masse because it's just too messy. The\ncontents of rate_schedule_description often contain numbers and acronyms\nthat have little to no meaning out of context. The table is structured\nsomewhat like the FERC1 small generators table with headings about rate\nstructure type also embedded into the rate_schedule_description column. To\nall who dare, beware.\n\nThis table is a combination of one pre-2021 (DBF) table and nine post-2020\n(XBRL) tables--one for each rate schedule type plus totals--hence increase\nin data clarity post-2020. The rate_schedule_type and billing_status\ncolumns are only relevant for post-2020 data as they can be reliably parsed\nfrom each of the tables and incorporated into columns. The\nrate_schedule_description is supposed to contain sub-rate_schedule_type\nnames for charges (Ex: Residential 1, Residential 2, etc.). However, the\npre-2021 data contains a little bit of everything (or nothing) and the\npost-2020 has some totals or wonky data thrown in. That's to say, even when\nworking with post-2020 data, be wary of aggregating the data. That's what\nthe \"total\" rows are for.\n\nThe values that come from from the totals table are marked with the string\n\"total\" in the rate_schedule_description column. The totals table is a\nproduct of the transition to XBRL, so these distinguishable totals are only\navailable for data post-2020 (otherwise you could try keyword searching for\n\"total\" in rate_schedule_description). The total table contains two types of\ntotals, the utility totals across all rate schedules in a given year\n(marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and rate_schedule_type =\n\"total\") and each of the utility's individual rate schedule totals in a\ngiven year (marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and\nrate_schedule_type = \"residential\" or any other rate schedule type).\n\nThe rate schedule based XBRL tables only report billed values whereas the\ntotal tables report billed, unbilled, and total values. (See the column\ndescription for more info on the difference between billed and unbilled).\nThis is important to consider if you're endeavoring to compare the subtotal\nvalues with the total values. We have not attempted to fix or verify any\nsubtotals or totals that don't add up.\n\nAnother important note is the possibility of unit discrepancies in certain\ncolumns. The revenue_per_kwh column does not specify reporting units, and\ncloser inspection of the data reveals two clear peaks approximate two orders\nof magnitude apart. This indicates that values may be reported in both\ndollars and cents. However, because the price of energy per kwh varies\nso much regionally, we cannot guarantee which is which and have not put\nany cleaning mechanisms in place to account for this.",

These FERC\nrecords can correspond to an entire plant, individual generators within a plant, all\ngenerators in a plant with the same prime mover type, or just the respondent's ownership\nshare of any of those categories (or other categories). Furthermore, the same utility\nmay report the same plant in different ways in different years.\n\nThe EIA data associated with each FERC plant record comes from our Plant Parts EIA\ntable, :ref:`out_eia__yearly_plant_parts`.\nThe EIA data in each record represents an aggregation of several slices of an EIA\nplant, across both physical characteristics and utility ownership.\n\nThis table inherits canonicalized values for generators and plants.\nEIA reports many attributes in many different tables across\nEIA-860 and EIA-923. In order to compile tidy, well-normalized database tables, PUDL\ncollects all instances of these values and and chooses a canonical value. By default,\nPUDL chooses the most consistently reported value of a given attribute as long as it\nis at least 70% of the given instances reported. If an attribute was reported\ninconsistently across the original EIA tables, then it will show up as a\nnull value.",

To convert to units of power, the user must multiply by the installed capacity within the county.\n\n* Hourly capacity factors are spatially averaged across each county over the contiguous USA. There are a handful of counties that are too small to pick up representation on the HRRR operational forecast grid. As such, these counties will have no wind or solar power production curves.\n\n* Due to power production performance being correlated with panel temperatures, during cold sunny periods, some solar capacity factor values are greater than 1 (but less that 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Details\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe data in this table were produced by Vibrant Clean Energy, and are licensed to the public under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0).\n\nThe technologies provided are:\n\n1) Onshore wind assuming a 100m hub height and 120m rotor diameter;\n\n2) Offshore wind assuming a 140m hub height and 120m rotor diameter;\n\n3) Utility solar assuming a fixed axis panel tilted at latitude.\n\nThe foundation of the capacity factors provided here is the NOAA HRRR operational numerical weather prediction model. The HRRR covers the entire contiguous US at a horizontal resolution of 3 km. Forecasts are initialized each hour of the year. Forecast hour two (2) is used as the input data for the power algorithms. This forecast hour is chosen to trade-off the impact of the measurement and data assimilation procedure of the HRRR with the physics of the model to derive the most complete picture of the atmosphere at the forecast time horizon. \n\nFor wind capacity factors: vertical slices of the atmosphere are considered across the defined rotor swept area. Bringing together wind speed, density, temperature and icing information, a power capacity is estimated using a representative power coefficient (Cp) curve to determine the power from a given wind speed, atmospheric density and temperature. There is no wake modeling included in the dataset.\n\nFor solar capacity factors: pertinent surface weather variables are pulled such as incoming short wave radiation, direct normal irradiance (calculated in the HRRR 2016 forward), surface temperature and other parameters. These are used in a non-linear I-V curve translation to power capacity factors.",
