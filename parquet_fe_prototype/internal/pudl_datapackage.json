However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets.

The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.",

This generation only includes generating units that are managed by a BA\nor whose operations are visible to a BA.\n\nGenerators on the distribution system—both large-scale resources and small-scale\ndistributed resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems—are typically not\nincluded.\n\nIn some electricity publications, EIA reports generation from all utility-scale\ngenerating units in the United States. BAs only meter generating units that are from a\nsubset of all utility-scale generating units. As a result, when hourly generation from\nthe EIA-930 is aggregated to monthly or annual levels, the results will be lower than\nmonthly and annual aggregations in other EIA electricity publications.\n\nInterchange is the net metered tie line flow from one BA to another directly\ninterconnected BA. This table includes the net sum of all interchange occurring between\na BA all of its directly interconnected neighboring BAs. For a detailed breakdown of\ninterchange between each pair of adjacent BAs see\n:ref:`core_eia930__hourly_interchange`.\n\nNegative interchange values indicate net inflows, and positive interchange values\nindicate net outflows.\n\nDemand is a calculated value representing the amount of electricity load within a BA's\nelectric system. A BA derives its demand value by taking the total metered net\nelectricity generation within its electric system and subtracting the total metered net\nelectricity interchange occurring between the BA and its neighboring BAs.\n\nEach BA produces a day-ahead electricity demand forecast for every hour of the next day.\nThese forecasts help BAs plan for and coordinate the reliable operation of their\nelectric system.",

This complexity makes attribution difficult for, as an example,\nallocating pollution to energy producers. Furthermore, heterogeneity within plant_ids\nmake aggregation to the parent entity difficult or inappropriate.\n\nThis table inherits from the EPA's crosswalk, the ID's from EPA CAMD\ncore_epacems__hourly_emissions table itself, the core_eia860__assn_boiler_generator table and the\ncore_eia860__scd_generators table. While the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd table is the core backbone of the table,\nEPA CAMD id's ensure there is complete coverage of EPA CAMD reporting units. The EIA 860\ntable addition ensures there is also complete coverage of those units as well.\n\nFor more information about the how this subplant_id is made, see the documentation for\npudl.etl.glue_assets.make_subplant_ids and pudl.etl.glue_assets.update_subplant_ids\nfrom: https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/nightly/autoapi/index.html\n\nBut by analyzing the relationships between combustors and generators,\nas provided in the core_epa__assn_eia_epacamd crosswalk, we can identify distinct power plants.\nThese are the smallest coherent units of aggregation.\n\nThis table does not have primary keys because the primary keys would have been:\nplant_id_eia, generator_id, subplant_id and emissions_unit_id_epa, but there are some\nnull records in the generator_id column because ~2 percent of all EPA CAMD records are not\nsuccessfully mapped to EIA generators.",

      "description": "The pre-2021 data in this table (extracted from FoxProDB vs. XBRL) is\nextremely unstructured. Where the post-2020 data (from XBRL) sorts the data\ninto rate schedule types: residential, industrial, commercial,\npublic_lighting, public_authorities, railroads, interdepartmental,\nprovision_for_rate_refund, commercial_and_industrial, total, and billing\nstatus: billed, unbilled, total, the pre-2021 data stuffs all of that\ninformation (if you're lucky) into the rate_schedule_description column.\nThere's no point trying to parse through the pre 2021\nrate_schedule_description column en masse because it's just too messy. The\ncontents of rate_schedule_description often contain numbers and acronyms\nthat have little to no meaning out of context. The table is structured\nsomewhat like the FERC1 small generators table with headings about rate\nstructure type also embedded into the rate_schedule_description column. To\nall who dare, beware.\n\nThis table is a combination of one pre-2021 (DBF) table and nine post-2020\n(XBRL) tables--one for each rate schedule type plus totals--hence increase\nin data clarity post-2020. The rate_schedule_type and billing_status\ncolumns are only relevant for post-2020 data as they can be reliably parsed\nfrom each of the tables and incorporated into columns. The\nrate_schedule_description is supposed to contain sub-rate_schedule_type\nnames for charges (Ex: Residential 1, Residential 2, etc.). However, the\npre-2021 data contains a little bit of everything (or nothing) and the\npost-2020 has some totals or wonky data thrown in. That's to say, even when\nworking with post-2020 data, be wary of aggregating the data. That's what\nthe \"total\" rows are for.\n\nThe values that come from from the totals table are marked with the string\n\"total\" in the rate_schedule_description column. The totals table is a\nproduct of the transition to XBRL, so these distinguishable totals are only\navailable for data post-2020 (otherwise you could try keyword searching for\n\"total\" in rate_schedule_description). The total table contains two types of\ntotals, the utility totals accross all rate schedules in a given year\n(marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and rate_schedule_type =\n\"total\") and each of the utility's individual rate schedule totals in a\ngiven year (marked with rate_schedule_description = \"total\" and\nrate_schdedule_type = \"residential\" or any other rate schdedule type).\n\nThe rate schedule based XBRL tables only report billed values whereas the\ntotal tables report billed, unbilled, and total values. (See the column\ndescription for more info on the difference between billed and unbilled).\nThis is important to consider if you're endeavoring to compare the subtotal\nvalues with the total values. We have not attempted to fix or verify any\nsubtotals or totals that don't add up.\n\nAnother important note is the possability of unit discrepancies in certain\ncolumns. The revenue_per_kwh column does not specify reporting units, and\ncloser inspection of the data reveals two clear peaks approximate two orders\nof magnitude appart. This indicates that values may be reported in both\ndollars and cents. However, because the price of energy per kwh varies\nso much regionally, we cannot guarantee which is which and have not put\nany cleaning mechanisms in place to account for this.",

There can be multiple deliveries of\nthe same type of fuel from the same supplier to the same plant in a single month, so the\ntable has no natural primary key.\n\nThere can be a significant delay between the receipt of fuel and its consumption, so\nusing this table to infer monthly attributes associated with power generation may not be\nentirely accurate. However, this is the most granular data we have describing fuel\ncosts, and we use it in calculating the marginal cost of electricity for individual\ngeneration units.\n\nUnder some circumstances utilities are allowed to treat the price of fuel as proprietary\nbusiness data, meaning it is redacted from the publicly available spreadsheets. It's\nstill reported to EIA and influences the aggregated (state, region, annual, etc.) fuel\nprices they publish. From 2009-2021 about 1/3 of all prices are redacted. The missing\ndata is not randomly distributed. Deregulated markets dominated by merchant generators\n(independent power producers) redact much more data, and natural gas is by far the most\nlikely fuel to have its price redacted. This means, for instance, that the entire\nNortheastern US reports essentially no fine-grained data about its natural gas prices.\n\nAdditional data which we haven't yet integrated is available in a similar format from\n2002-2008 via the EIA-423, and going back as far as 1972 from the FERC-423.",

There are many\nattributes of generators (i.e. prime mover, primary fuel source, technology\ntype). We can use these generator attributes to group generator records into\nlarger aggregate records which we call \"plant parts\". A plant part is a record\nwhich corresponds to a particular collection of generators that all share an\nidentical attribute and utility owner. E.g. all of the generators with unit_id=2, or all\nof the generators with coal as their primary fuel source.\n\nThe EIA data about power plants (from EIA 923 and 860) is reported in tables\nwith records that correspond to mostly generators and plants. Other datasets\n(cough cough FERC1) are less well organized and include plants, generators and\nother plant parts all in the same table without any clear labels. This plant part table\nis an attempt to create records corresponding to many different plant parts in order to\nconnect specific slices of EIA plants to other datasets.\n\nBecause generators are often owned by multiple utilities, another dimension of\nthis plant part table involves generating two records for each owner: one for the\nportion of the plant part they own and one for the plant part as a whole. The\nportion records are labeled in the ``ownership_record_type`` column as ``owned``\nand the total records are labeled as ``total``.\n\nThis table includes A LOT of duplicative information about EIA plants. It is primarily\nmeant for use as an input into the record linkage between FERC1 plants and EIA.",

This table includes data from the pre-2021 CSV raw source as well as the newer 2021 through present XBRL raw source.\n\nAn important caveat to note is that there was some cleaning done to the datetime_utc timestamps. The Form 714 includes sparse documentation for respondents for how to interpret timestamps - the form asks respondents to provide 24 instances of hourly demand for each day. The form is labeled with hour 1-24. There is no indication if hour 1 begins at midnight.\n\nThe XBRL data contained several formats of timestamps. Most records corresponding to hour 1 of the Form have a timestamp with hour 1 as T1. About two thirds of the records in the hour 24 location of the form have a timestamp with an hour reported as T24 while the remaining third report this as T00 of the next day. T24 is not a valid format for the hour of a datetime, so we convert these T24 hours into T00 of the next day. A smaller subset of the respondents reports the 24th hour as the last second of the day - we also convert these records to the T00 of the next day.\n\nThis table includes three respondent ID columns: one from the CSV raw source, one from the XBRL raw source and another that is PUDL-derived that links those two source ID's together. This table has filled in source IDs for all records so you can select the full timeseries for a given respondent from any of these three IDs.",

      "description": "The data in this table were produced by Vibrant Clean Energy, and are licensed to the public under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0). The table consists of estimated county-averaged hourly capacity factors for wind and solar generating facilities across the contiguous United States (US) to be used as a tool and input for resource adequacy modeling and planning. The hourly capacity factors are normalized to unity for maximal power output. To convert to units of power, the user must multiply by the installed capacity within the county.\n\nThe technologies provided are:\n1) Onshore wind assuming a 100m hub height and 120m rotor diameter;\n2) Offshore wind assuming a 140m hub height and 120m rotor diameter;\n3) Utility solar assuming a fixed axis panel tilted at latitude.\n\nThe foundation of the capacity factors provided here is the NOAA HRRR operational numerical weather prediction model. The HRRR covers the entire contiguous US at a horizontal resolution of 3 km. Forecasts are intialized each hour of the year. Forecast hour two (2) is used as the input data for the power algorithms. This forecast hour is chosen to trade-off the impact of the measurement and data assimilation procedure of the HRRR with the physics of the model to derive the most complete picture of the atmosphere at the forecast time horizon. Hourly capacity factors are spatially averaged across each county over the contiguous USA. There are a handful of counties that are too small to pick up representation on the HRRR operational forecast grid. As such, these counties will have no wind or solar power production curves.\n\nFor wind capacity factors: vertical slices of the atmosphere are considered across the defined rotor swept area. Bringing together wind speed, density, temperature and icing information, a power capacity is estimated using a representative power coefficient (Cp) curve to determine the power from a given wind speed, atmospheric density and temperature. There is no wake modeling included in the dataset.\n\nFor solar capacity factors: pertinent surface weather variables are pulled such as incoming short wave radiation, direct normal irradiance (calculated in the HRRR 2016 forward), surface temperature and other parameters. These are used in a non-linear I-V curve translation to power capacity factors. Due to power production performance being correlated with panel temperatures, during cold sunny periods, some solar capacity factor values are greater than 1 (but less that 1.1).",
